## An introduction of William Bean ##

Hello not-so-anonymous internet user-agent.  I am William Bean, a human living on Earth in the nation of the United States of America, in the state of Illinois, in the area of the Quad Cities.

I do web app technology stuff for a little company called [John Deere](http://www.deere.com).

Most of my hobbies also involve tinkering with technology.  I enjoy pinball, poker, & biking with friends.  You might also find me at the [Quad Cities Linux User Group](http://qclug.org).

I have a beautiful wife and twin 5-year-old daughters.  We spend time horsing around the neighborhood, camping, hiking, swimming, being loud, building with legos and, in general, laughing & loving. 

We are a happy and thankful peoples, and I hope you, dear reader, find yourself in similar overall spirits.
