## An introduction of William Bean ##

Hello not-so-anonymous internet user-agent.  I am William Bean, a human living on Earth in the nation of the United States of America, in the state of Illinois, in the area of the Quad Cities.

I do technology stuff for a living with a little company called [John Deere](http://www.deere.com).

Most of my hobbies also involve tinkering with technology.  I also like to do pinball, legos, & biking. 

I have a beautiful wife and twin daughters.  We spend time horsing around the neighborhood, camping, hiking, swimming, being loud, and, in general, laughing & loving. 

We are a happy and thankful peoples, and I hope you, dear reader, find yourself in similar overall spirits as well.
