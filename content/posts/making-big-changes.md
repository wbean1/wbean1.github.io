I've lived a life of small, iterative changes.  Both personally and professionally, these types of changes are generally safest.  However, this year I've tossed this strategy out the proverbial window:

1. **New(er) House** - Bigger, better, and more in debt.  Complete with a home-office, this has been a great move.  QOL++
2. **New Job** - I'm no longer a John Deere employee!  Career moves are hard, but this opportunity with Pivotal was a big change in all the right ways.  Time to spread the IT wings and fly.
3. **Baby #3** - Thats right.  We've got another Bean otw, due ~22Mar19!  Reset that retirement clock.


Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  Lifes for livin'.
