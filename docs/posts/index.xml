      <description>So you want to run a platform&amp;hellip; Firstly, are you sure?
The as-a-service revolution is well underway, as this great article from Luke Kanies spells out. See also the momentous, if not dated, PaaS for Realists. Running your own anything anymore seems to be for the birds.
  But ok. You have your job cut out for you.
What are some of the requirements for running this thing you&amp;rsquo;re endevouring to deliver?</description>

      <description>The Open Source Explosion It is a pretty good time to be alive if you like tinkering with computer software. There is a literal ton (I weighed it, just trust me) of free-to-use, open source software out there to take up your days, and help you accomplish crazy things, crazy efficiently.
As you can tell from my resume, I make use of a lot of this software professionally:
 ansible apache httpd apache tomcat cloudfoundry collectd concourse docker elasticsearch grafana haproxy influxdb jenkins kibana logstash memcached mysql / mariadb nagios nginx packer postgres prometheus puppet samba sonarqube terraform  But what makes an open source project &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;?</description>
