      <description>Writing, and maybe Inspiration Like probably every human that is not a profesional writer, I find it fairly difficult to get into a writing flow-state. I then use this as an excuse not to write, and to think I&amp;rsquo;m bad at it. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been great at expressing emotions, and even when speaking frequently the words just seem to come from some place other than my brain.
I have recently been inspired to give this writing thing another go.</description>

      <description>Ch-ch-ch-changes   I&amp;rsquo;ve lived a life of small, iterative changes. Both personally and professionally, these types of changes are generally safest. However, this year I&amp;rsquo;ve tossed this strategy out the proverbial window:
 New(er) House - Bigger, better, and more in debt. Complete with a home-office, this has been a great move. QOL++ New Job - I&amp;rsquo;m no longer a John Deere employee! Career moves are hard, but this opportunity with Pivotal was a big change in all the right ways.</description>

      <description>Prepare to enter a restart loop I&amp;rsquo;ve been poking at using go for a side project for about a month now, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to show for it.
Other than a vague feeling that &amp;gt;1000 other devs have recently made this same troublesome, looping sojourn, I&amp;rsquo;m left with not very much concrete progress.
Two images spring to my mind:
  Back in like 1996, I had a sweet geocities webpage where I fiddled around learning html.</description>

      <description>So you want to run a platform&amp;hellip; Firstly, are you sure?
The as-a-service revolution is well underway, as this great article from Luke Kanies spells out. See also the momentous, if not dated, PaaS for Realists. Running your own anything anymore seems to be for the birds.
  But ok. You have your job cut out for you.
What are some of the requirements for running this thing you&amp;rsquo;re endevouring to deliver?</description>

      <description>The Open Source Explosion It is a pretty good time to be alive if you like tinkering with computer software. There is a literal ton (I weighed it, just trust me) of free-to-use, open source software out there to take up your days, and help you accomplish crazy things, crazy efficiently.
As you can tell from my resume, I make use of a lot of this software professionally:
 ansible apache httpd apache tomcat cloudfoundry collectd concourse docker elasticsearch grafana haproxy influxdb jenkins kibana logstash memcached mysql / mariadb nagios nginx packer postgres prometheus puppet samba sonarqube terraform  But what makes an open source project &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;?</description>
